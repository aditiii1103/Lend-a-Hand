        We run a one-year programme to facilitate school readiness for children from low-income communities aged 4-6 years. The idea is to build a strong foundation in language and social skills in a safe, secure, and happy learning environment.
        After kindergarten, the NGO also continues to support them through their school years and until they become employable.
